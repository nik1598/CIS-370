      <h1>About Me</h1>
	  <img src= "about_photo.jpg" alt= "Jhansi Kesireddy" />
      <p> I am Jhansi Kesireddy. I am from Telangana, India. I came to the
	  United States to study right after my high school. I like to travel a lot 
	  and the US has a lot of cool places to visit, so that is something 
	  I really love about here.</p>
       
	   <p><strong> Education: </strong> I finished my high school in India and came to 
       the US for college. I am an IT Application Development 
	   major at <em>Missouri State University</em>. I was originally supposed to graduate
	   this May, but because I changed my major a 100 million times,
	   I will be graduating this December. I plan to do PhD degree upon graduation.
	   I am interested in researching more about Cybersecurity topics.</p>

	   <p><strong> Work Experience: </strong> I currently work as a Computer Lab 
	   Assistant for <em>Missouri State University</em>. I love my job a lot. I get to
	   meet different people everyday. I get to juggle with computers and other
	   lab machines. I will be working for American National this summer, so I am
	   excited about that.</p>

	   <p><strong> Family: </strong> My parents live in India. I have a younger 
	   sister who is in high school, who also lives in India. They visit me here 
	   in summers sometimes. We as a family travel a lot too. Usually, in India, 
	   there is belief that women cook better than men, but in our family, my dad 
	   cooks amazing food.</p>
